**Approaches to Openness: Digital Archaeology Data in Virginia and Public Engagement**

Jolene Smith, Virginia Department of Historic Resources

Society for Historical Archaeology, January 2016

**Abstract** : Virginia's archaeological site inventory contains detailed information on nearly 43,000 sites in datasets maintained by the Department of Historic Resources (State Historic Preservation Office). At times, responsibility to protect sensitive sites from looting and vandalism seems to run counter to providing information to the public about Virginia's archaeology. But the two are not mutually exclusive. This paper will explore Virginia's historical approach to archaeological data dissemination with regards to both risks and benefits. This paper will also outline future initiatives to maximize site data availability for different types of users. By leveraging archaeological site information to create a sense of stewardship among local governments, development interests, and the general public, we may be able to protect Virginia's buried heritage more effectively than ever before.

It's nearly comprehensive, but we do miss out on information from some academic archaeology, investigations conducted by private foundations, etc. All that is to say we have  a lot, but we don't have everything.

[2] The Department of Historic Resources is the State Historic Preservation Office for Virginia, so much of the data we collect reflects the needs of compliance with environmental regulations as well as supporting the workflow for listing historic properties on the National Register of Historic Places. The vast majority of our data has been created in response to the growth of the Cultural Resource Management industry after the 1966 introduction of the National Historic Preservation Act.

Historically, approaches by our agency to data-sharing have been very much ad-hoc. Generally, research required one-on-one contact between a researcher and SHPO staff, although  depending on staffing, security varied. In the early days, researchers could pull records straight from files, but as time progressed, Archives staff provided more oversight (Barber 2015).

All this changed as DHR transitioned to electronic systems. [3] In 1991 the agency began using IPS (Integrated Preservation Software), an offline relational database developed with the National Park Service and distributed between individuals and institutions and then manually synced as needed (Virginia Department of Historic Resources 2001) (while a game changer, this system was about as beloved as you might think). For the first time, archaeological site records were digitized, although only new work. NPS encouraged new kinds of multi-state analysis and new

Between the late 1990s through early 2000s, DHR staff and contractors t

 from paper records and migrated IPS data into the new Historic Resources Data Sharing System (DSS)[4], one of the first web databases in the country with comprehensive state archaeological site data. DSS access was limited to professional archaeologists, planners, environmental firms, and other qualified individuals. For the first time, users had access to statewide information with querying power and a full web GIS. In the mid 2000s, we also began distributing statewide, county, and

NOTE: 'Yes! Only to orgs with authority to access DSS, but the detailed geospatial data has been "out there" for quite a long time now.

We found the full dataset in downloadable form on another state agency's site a while back (it came down VERY quickly). It was pretty well buried, but still made its way out there.'
NOTE: ' In this way, the bell has already been rung.']

[5] In 2013, DHR transitioned to VCRIS, a new, more powerful web database and map. We introduced tiered access in order to allow for conditional security and data restriction (some users are authorized to access the statewide archaeology and architectural dataset, others are restricted to architecture, etc.). VCRIS includes a public viewer, although it is currently limited to architectural point data, as well as a full GIS feature service allowing for authorized users to access live

is now possible for authorized users outside of DHR database administrators. It's not pretty, but it's possible.

In the DSS era, access to information was generally limited to users who paid an annual or quarterly access fee, with waivers for "strategic partners" and specific projects on a case by case basis. VCRIS operates on a similar fee-for-service  model (and its maintenance/enhancements are completely funded by these fees), although DHR has formalized complimentary access and made it easier for academic researchers to access data at no cost.

While we are very electronic, many researchers (both professional and nonprofessional) come in person to the DHR reading room. Security has varied over the years, but has been largely reliant on reading room staff to ask specific questions and verify the intentions of information seekers before data is released. Recently we've introduced a

 must sign that collects information about professional qualifications and reason for visit in order to reduce the need for sometimes awkward interrogation by desk staff.

To sum up this this history lesson and to put all this back into context, DHR's data can be seen as "open" or "closed" in a few different ways [6]:

- ●●Ease of access: how fast (or difficult) is it for a researcher to get the information they need?
- ●●Audience with access: Can someone who works at DHR get the information? How about a CRM archaeologist? A graduate student out of state? An interested member of the public?
- ●●Usability of the data: Can a researcher easily get the information out of its parent document for further analysis?
- ●●Cost of access: If the information is not free, is the cost easy to absorb? Does the cost of accessing the information disincentivize thorough research?

T **oward An Open Approach**

In 2012, Joshua Wells and David Anderson approached us with an intriguing request: send our whole database (or a large chunk of it) off to be a part of DINAA (the Digital Index for American Archaeology), where it would be linked with databases from other states and publicly accessible, with specific locations and sensitive details protected. When I received the initial communications, I was very excited by the concept. I had been doing some very basic research on interoperability of databases, and this was coming at a perfect time. I was, however, a bit nervous about how my colleagues would react to such a dramatic shift toward openness in what has traditionally been a fairly restrictive environment. I made a case to the State Archaeologist and DHR's Archivist and they agreed to participate. [7] As of today, select fields from Virginia's entire inventory as of 2013 are available for anyone to access through DINAA and our time periods and site type descriptions have been integrated into a

. A critical shortage of available storage space as well as a major opportunity for public outreach inspired an ongoing proof of concept digital repository project. This project will identify a selection of low-risk (mostly because of destruction) and high-interest archaeological reports and project documentation for integration into a digital repository with a free, public web portal.

The repository will be to current digital archives standards and will also incorporate elements of linked open data to connect the amazing resources at DHR with the wider world.

Earlier this year, my small agency had an all-staff meeting. This time around, our keynote speaker was David Givens, archaeologist at Jamestown. He gave us a really wonderful overview of the top stories from Jamestown. [8] He spoke to us about researching a silver reliquary and trying to identify its contents based on imaging. There was a lead item inside the box and its identity was unclear. After much online searching, he came upon an example of a lead ampulle in the digital catalog of the Museum of London [9]. It was a breakthrough. That was what was in the box at Jamestown. There were oohs and ahhs from the DHR audience. And I thought to myself, "we HAVE this." Well not this pictured 15th century lead ampulla _exactly_, but we have so many pieces of so many puzzles in our collections. Our materials could be making national and international news just like this.

**Risks of Rapid Change and Downsides to Openness**

[10] Blowing Virginia's archaeological dataset wide open is a pretty radical concept. Just think about the imagery. It's explosive. Call me a fuddy duddy, but I prefer my explosions to be of the controlled sort [11].

Reservations about opening up archaeological data generally fall into three groups:

_[12] Someone might steal my ideas._ From the perspective of a state-level archive, this point actually hasn't been raised very frequently. When materials are submitted to us, they become publically accessible to a limited degree by default.

However, it has been very challenging to keep up with academic work (namely theses and dissertations) and that's something we could improve upon in the future.

 The open scholarship community is active and growing and can provide much more on why this concern isn't or shouldn't be valid. See Eric Kansa's recent essay entitled "Click Here to Save Archaeology" for more on this issue and others only superficially touched upon in this paper (2015).

_[13] We won't be able to make any money from this._ Sadly, this point is one that hits close to home. I do not mean to imply that my agency is out to make a tidy profit from archaeologists just trying to do some research, but the fact of the matter is that our digital information infrastructure and in-person reading room are currently structured to support themselves. VCRIS is currently funded exclusively through license fees and DHR Archives see ever-dwindling revenue from in person visits (copies, scanning, etc.). Restructuring funding models is a hard sell because it's hard to do, but I argue we must look for different

.

_[14] Publishing archaeological information might attract looters._ This is a valid concern and one that isn't taken lightly by SHPO archaeologists or others in the archaeological community. The challenge is finding the appropriate balance. Maximizing overall benefit to sites, communities, our agency, and researchers, while minimizing risk. Unfortunately this risk isn't easily quantifiable, so we're stuck with best guesses. I

 propose that the professional looters (at least in Virginia) know where to look. They've identified the locations of Civil War earthworks and campsites. They've researched the locations of burial caves and mounds. We may have more to fear from the casual or opportunistic looter. By releasing detailed site information connected to buffered locational data on all but the most sensitive sites, I argue that we can approach this balance.

There have been instances in the past when individuals out to find treasure have accessed or attempted to access archaeological records through DHR's reading room. In one case a large amount of information on shipwrecks was provided to a treasure hunter without proper screening. In another case, a member of a relic hunting message board proposed a concerted effort to visit DHR and request records under false pretense (but we check those boards, too). In both of these cases, the bad actors were motivated by finding very specific coordinate information, not comparative research data.

But the adage "you can't un-ring a bell" comes to mind. If we put this information out there, what

if it is too much? What if something goes wrong. I argue that the time to take a series of calculated risks is now.

**Positive Implications of Openness**

[15] So, let's for a moment imagine that we've made a lot of progress opening up Virginia's data, well on our way to utopia. Some significant portion of our collection of over 6 million objects is digitized, linked, and accessible to anyone. Information about time periods and site types for our statewide inventory is public (and we're already there for the time

As they arrive, raw datasets are indexed and published, to be tapped into by researchers worldwide.

 (Kansa 2015). Researchers who are currently locked out by the restrictive nature of our non-commercial complimentary VCRIS account policy may take advantage of access to information.

As an employee of a government agency, I work within a structure of metrics, performance measures, and beans to count (whether I like it or not). Well, here are so many beans! My pitch to superiors who are rightfully concerned with financial solvency is this: how do we make ourselves as an agency indispensable to the outside world? When we are faced with a political administration who is not sympathetic to archaeology or historic preservation, who will write the letters to the Capitol?

I don't argue that this is the reason to open our data, but I do hold that a widespread investment by outsiders in DHR's collection of information has the potential to serve a protective function.
